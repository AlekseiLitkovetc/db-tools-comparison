# DB Benchmarks

This is a separate project created specially for DB benchmarks.

At this moment, there is only one sample - [Hello World](JMHSample_01_HelloWorld.scala) benchmark.
The other expected benchmarks will be added a bit later.

As for now, in demonstration purposes, to run the "Hello World" benchmark, see instruction in the main [README.md](../../../../../../../README.md:73)
